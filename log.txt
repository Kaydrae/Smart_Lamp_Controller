Creating the UI and basic functionality of the app along with some test data. Should take about 2-3 hours.
The time it has taken was about the 2.5 hours. This is because even though the UI elements are drag and drop I did not remember how to interact with them so 
I had to do some research to learn how to do it.

Today I will work on trying to create a solid UI for all of the form pages and have them Id with the correct ID I think it will take about
3 hours just because I am not sure how everything will look together, there may be a lot of rearranging going on. Ran into a few problems 
with compiling the code, but after a few hours in the internet I was able to figure it out.
